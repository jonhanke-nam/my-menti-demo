# Menti Clone — Project Spec (CLAUDE.md)

## Project Overview

A locally-deployed, real-time interactive polling/presentation app inspired by Mentimeter.
A **presenter** creates a session with slides (questions), shares a room code, and **participants**
join on their phones or browsers to vote. Results update live on the presenter's screen.

---

## Goals for Local Deployment

- Runs entirely on `localhost` — no cloud services required
- Presenter and participants connect over the same local network (e.g. home or office Wi-Fi)
- Participants join via the host machine's local IP (e.g. `http://192.168.x.x:3000/join`)
- Data persists to a local SQLite database (no Postgres setup needed for local dev)
- Redis replaced by in-memory adapter for Socket.io (no external services)

## Tech Stack

### Back End
| Concern | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime | Node.js (v20+) | Ecosystem, Socket.io support |
| Framework | Express | Lightweight, well-known |
| Real-time | Socket.io | Easiest WebSocket abstraction |
| Database | SQLite via `better-sqlite3` | Zero-config, file-based, perfect for local |
| ORM | Drizzle ORM | Lightweight, TypeScript-friendly, great SQLite support |

## API Routes

### Auth
```
POST /api/auth/register   { email, password } → { token }
POST /api/auth/login      { email, password } → { token }
```

### Presentations (requires JWT)
```
GET    /api/presentations          → list presenter's presentations
POST   /api/presentations          → create new presentation
GET    /api/presentations/:id      → get single presentation with questions
PUT    /api/presentations/:id      → update title
DELETE /api/presentations/:id      → delete
POST   /api/presentations/:id/activate  → generate room code, mark active
```

### Questions (requires JWT)
```
POST   /api/questions              { presentationId, type, prompt, options } → question
PUT    /api/questions/:id          → update question
DELETE /api/questions/:id          → delete question
GET    /api/questions/:id/results  → get aggregated results
```

### Public (no auth)
```
GET /api/join/:roomCode   → validate room code, return active question
```

## Slide Types (MVP)

### 1. Multiple Choice
- Presenter provides a prompt + 2–4 options
- Participant taps one option
- Results displayed as a **bar chart**

### 2. Word Cloud
- Presenter provides a prompt
- Participant types a single word or short phrase
- Results displayed as a **word cloud** (size = frequency)

### 3. Open Text
- Presenter provides a prompt
- Participant types a free-text answer
- Results displayed as a **scrolling list** of responses

## Local Network Setup

To allow participants on the same Wi-Fi to connect:

1. Find your machine's local IP:
   - Mac/Linux: `ipconfig getifaddr en0` or `hostname -I`
   - Windows: `ipconfig` → look for IPv4 address
2. Start the server binding to `0.0.0.0` (not just localhost)
3. Participants visit `http://<your-ip>:3000/join` on their phones
4. Presenter uses `http://localhost:3000` as normal

The Vite dev server should also be started with `--host` flag to allow LAN access if testing the client separately.

---

## Environment Variables

```env
# server/.env
PORT=4000
JWT_SECRET=your_local_secret_here
DATABASE_URL=./dev.db
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000

# client/.env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
VITE_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

---

## Build & Run (Local)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install          # from root (installs both workspaces)

# Run database migrations
cd server && npm run db:migrate

# Start back end (port 4000)
cd server && npm run dev

# Start front end (port 3000)
cd client && npm run dev -- --host
```

---

## MVP Build Order

Build in this order to always have a working vertical slice:

1. **Server bootstrap** — Express + Socket.io listening, health check route
2. **Database + schema** — Drizzle schema, migrations, SQLite file
3. **Auth routes** — register/login, JWT middleware
4. **Presentation + question CRUD** — REST routes, tested via Postman/curl
5. **Socket.io rooms** — presenter joins, participant joins, room logic
6. **Voting flow** — participant:vote → save to DB → broadcast results
7. **React shell** — Vite + Router + Tailwind + Zustand wired to socket
8. **JoinPage + ParticipantView** — mobile-first, submit a vote
9. **PresenterView** — show active question, live bar chart updates
10. **Dashboard** — create/edit presentations and questions
11. **Word cloud + open text** — add remaining slide types
12. **Polish** — transitions, error states, reconnection handling

---

## Out of Scope (for now)

- User-uploaded images on slides
- PDF/PPT export of results
- Paid tiers or usage limits
- Cloud deployment
- Emoji reactions / Q&A upvoting
- Mobile native apps

## Conversation Audit Trail

Every Claude Code session MUST be logged in the `conversations/` folder for full transparency and reproducibility. Each session produces **two files**: a concise summary and a detailed verbatim log.

### Rules for Claude

1. **At the start of every session**, create two new log files:
   - `conversations/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_summary.md` — concise summary log
   - `conversations/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_detailed.md` — detailed verbatim log
2. **After every interaction** (each user message + Claude response pair), **append** to BOTH files immediately. Do not wait until the end of the session.
3. **This is a BLOCKING requirement** — update both log files before moving on to other work after each response.
4. **Never skip an interaction** — both logs must be complete, continuous records of everything that happened in the session.

### Summary Log Format (`_summary.md`)

A quick-reference overview of the session. Each interaction includes:
- Separator line (`---`)
- Timestamp heading (`## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] — Short description`)
- **User:** 1–2 sentence paraphrase of the request
- **Claude:** Brief description of what was done
- **Actions:** Bullet list of tool calls / commands / file changes (e.g., "Created file X", "Ran `npm install`", "Edited CLAUDE.md lines 297-340")

### Detailed Log Format (`_detailed.md`)

A near-verbatim record that lets a reader fully understand the conversation. Each interaction includes:
- Separator line (`---`)
- Timestamp heading (`## [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]`)
- **User:** The user's full, actual message (quoted verbatim)
- **Claude:** Claude's full response text as displayed to the user
- **Tool Calls:** For each tool used, include:
  - The tool name and what it was called with (command, file path, etc.)
  - The key output or result (truncate very long outputs but keep enough to understand what happened)
  - Any errors encountered
- Keep this authentic — a reader should be able to follow the entire session as if they were watching over our shoulders.

### Folder structure

```
conversations/
├── 2026-02-25_06-11-03_summary.md     ← session 1 summary
├── 2026-02-25_06-11-03_detailed.md    ← session 1 full log

## Notes for Claude

- Prefer explicit types over `any` in TypeScript
- Keep Socket.io event handlers in `server/src/sockets/` — don't scatter them in route files
- Use Drizzle's query builder — avoid raw SQL unless necessary
- All DB access should go through a thin service layer, not directly in route handlers
- The `participant_id` is a UUID generated client-side and stored in `sessionStorage` — participants are anonymous but their votes are deduplicated per question per participant_id
- When broadcasting results, always send the **full aggregated counts object**, not deltas — simpler to reason about on the client
